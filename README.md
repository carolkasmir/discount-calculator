# Discount Calculator

This Python project contains a function named `calculate_discount` that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The function only applies the discount if the discount percentage is 20% or higher; otherwise, it returns the original price.

## Features

- **Calculate Discount:** The function calculates the final price based on the original price and discount percentage provided by the user.
- **Threshold for Discount:** If the discount percentage is below 20%, the original price is returned without any discount.
